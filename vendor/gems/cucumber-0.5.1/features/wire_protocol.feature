Feature: Wire Protocol
  In order to be allow Cucumber to touch my app in intimate places
  As a developer on platform which doesn't support Ruby
  I want a low-level protocol which Cucumber can use to run steps within my app

  #
  # Cucumber's wire protocol is an implementation of Cucumber's internal
  # 'programming language' abstraction, and allows step definitions to be
  # implemented and invoked on any platform.
  #
  # Communication is over a TCP socket, which Cucumber connects to when it finds
  # a definition file with the .wire extension in the step_definitions folder
  # (or other load path).
  #
  # Cucumber currently sends the following messages over the wire:
  #
  #   * step_matches   : this is used to find out whether the wire end has a
  #                      definition for a given step
  #   * invoke         : this is used to ask for a step definition to be invoked
  #   * begin_scenario : signals that cucumber is about to execute a scenario
  #   * end_scenario   : signals that cucumber has finished executing a scenario
  #   * snippet_text   : requests a snippet for an undefined step
  #
  # Message packets are formatted as JSON-encoded strings, with a newline
  # character signalling the end of a packet. These messages are described
  # below, with examples.
  #

  #
  # step_matches
  #
  # When the features have been parsed, Cucumber will send a step_matches
  # message to ask the wire end if it can match a step name. This happens for
  # each of the steps in each of the features.
  #
  # The wire end replies with a step_match array, containing the IDs of any step
  # definitions that could be invoked for the given step name.
