Longer Term:
- Foreign key support?

Questions:
- dom_id(model, :something) or "dom_id(model)_something"?
- javascript(void) or #

Next:
- MU: Cucumber specific names for import/export tasks?
      Search result pagination
      Empty import form causes validation error
      Add controls must be outside of list so that they do not interfere with drag and drop
      acts_as_list performance - is another alternative available that stores the order of the complete list in a single column
      Script injection protection
      Investigate Javascript test framework
      Validation errors causes height change - discuss with Pam
      Fix folder background
      Validation error messages to be discussed
      form_common is no longer 'common' as multiple forms do not use it - views/features is the best example
      feature.summary column size - must be unlimited or, at the least, very large
